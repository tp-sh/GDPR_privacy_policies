We and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in serving and measuring our advertising efficiently. This is to ensure that our viewers have a good user experience, (for example don’t see the same advertising over and over again) and to allow our advertisers to reach more viewers and know when ads have been served. 
</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.3,11;4.3,11">If you download any of our apps on a mobile device with a Google Android or Apple iOS operating system then you will be given an advertising identifier by that operating system. We use and pass this identifier to permitted third parties for frequency capping to limit repetitive advertising, for analytics purposes, or to enable us to serve you advertisements of particular relevance to you.

				</title>
			<paragraph category="10.3;10.3">Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use. We therefore have a legitimate interest in using information we hold about you to help us sell our advertising on a more personalised basis and to show you adverts that we think you’ll be interested in or which are more relevant to you. For example, if you live in Leeds then we would be more likely to show an ad for an event in Yorkshire - and less likely to see an ad for an event in London.
</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="11;11">We also pass an identifier relating to you and data about you to The Addressable Platform Limited (an advertising technology provider which is part of the ITV group) and to our trusted third party partners (such as Amobee Inc and GroupM UK Limited (who also work with Finecast Limited)) to enable them to match against other data they may legally hold and use that combined information to serve ads of particular relevance to you.</paragraph>

We and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in making sure that you don’t see repetitive or less relevant advertising across both our platforms and those run by third parties. We therefore share limited data with third parties to enable a match where you have also already shared your data with that party in the course of using their service; and (where there is a match) additional data to enable the third party and us to make advertising more relevant to you.
</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="11;11">We also work with third party advertisers and platforms (such as Facebook and Google) to advertise our products and services to the most relevant audiences. This can involve the provision of protected ID data (for example, an email address which is converted into a stream of numbers or letters (aka hashed) to help make it more secure) to match the data we hold about you with the data they hold on their platform and provide you with relevant advertising (subject to your ad permissions on the relevant platform). 
</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.3;4.3">If you have adjusted the ‘Personalisation’ settings in the ‘Manage Account’ section of the ITV Hub website, you may still see adverts and marketing from us on other services, but it won’t use this data.

			What about third parties?

		<paragraph category="19;19">We work with third parties to provide our products and services, and our products and services may contain links to other websites owned by third parties. 
</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="19;19">Sometimes when we include a link in our products and services, we use an affiliate link to earn income from purchases made by users who click on the link and go on to buy the product. These links do not affect our editorial content or decisions to recommend products, nor do they affect the price of any products. We will make clear to you which links are affiliate links. 
</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="19;19">We work with a company called Skimlinks to provide these links. When you click on one of the Skimlinks’ affiliate links, they may collect information about you.

			What are your rights?
			</title>
		<paragraph category="4;4">Any personal information you supply will be treated in accordance with applicable data protection laws including the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General DataProtection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and any other applicable or superseding legislation. We are committed to delivering the rights that individuals are entitled to under data protection laws in the UK. These are:</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.7;4.7">the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. To do this, please contact us at myprivacy@itv.com making clear that you are requesting a copy of your personal information and including full details of what you require. You may also be required to submit a proof of your identity.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.6;4.6">the right to object to your personal information being used for direct marketing. Where required we will ensure we obtain your consent before undertaking marketing and you will have the ability to opt out (see the section on "Direct Marketing" above).</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.6;4.6">the right to object to your personal information being processed where the legal basis for the processing is our own legitimate interests as a business (see "How will we use your information" section above). In some circumstances (for example, where we are using cookies or in respect of personalising editorial content or advertising or marketing) we have specific mechanisms to enable this objection. In all cases, we will comply with such a request unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so, such as when we need to continue to process your information to defend a legal claim or if this information is necessary for the ongoing provision of our products and services.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.3;4.3">the right to rectification. You may request that we correct any inaccurate and/or complete any incomplete personal information.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.9;4.9">the right to withdraw consent. Where we are processing your personal information on the basis that you have given us your consent to do so, you may withdraw your consent at any time.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.4;4.4">the right of erasure. You may request that we erase your personal information and we will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so. For example, there may be an overriding legitimate ground for retaining your personal information, such as keeping your payment information for several years to comply with HMRC rules.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.7;4.7">the right to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may request that we provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and have it transferred to another provider of the same or similar services to us. Where this right is applicable, we will comply with such transfer as far as it is technically feasible.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="1.2,4,7;1.2,4,7">the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. We suggest that you contact us about any questions or if you have a complaint in relation to how we process your personal information. However, you do have the right to contact the relevant supervisory authority directly. To contact the Information Commissioner’s Office in the United Kingdom, please visit the ICO website (www.ico.org.uk) for instructions.</paragraph>
