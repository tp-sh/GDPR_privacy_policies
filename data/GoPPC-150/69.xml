			<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">The app collects non-identifiable gameplay data to send to Apple iCloud, specifically to record a player’s progress (win record) vs the app’s built-in roster of computer opponents. We (Chess.com, LLC) do not store any of this data, but it is sent to Apple services (iCloud and Game Center) for storage and use. </paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9,11,4.9;8,9,11,4.9">The app also collects the user’s anonymized gamePlayerID for the app’s “Online Play” feature, where it is used exclusively to maintain a chess skill rating as online games are played. This helps ensure players are matched with opponents of similar skill levels. The collection of this data is subject to the user’s explicit permission, as requested in the app prior to first use, and can be subsequently terminated at any time via the app’s Settings (“Stop Collecting Data”). </paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9,11,15;8,9,11,15">The app is available to players of all ages through the Apple Arcade service and collects this non-identifiable gameplay data from all players without respect to age. The basis for this collection of information is to support the internal operations of the app as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (“COPPA”), which is a legitimate use under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). </paragraph>
