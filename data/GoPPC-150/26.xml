				<paragraph category="8,9.1,9.2,9.3,11;8,9.1,9.2,9.3,11">Indeed may also collect information about third-party websites you visit through our mobile software or while using Indeed for Chrome. This could include information about Job Listings, notes or application statuses that you submit, save, or update, or data regarding how you engage with websites or other actions you take on such websites, including URLs of websites you visit. We may also suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in applications you submit on third-party sites and see whether you make changes to these suggestions but not the changes themselves. We do this in order to allow a Job Seeker to keep a record of particular Job Listings of interest, to detect a job application on a third-party site to give a Job Seeker the option to auto-fill parts of the form using Indeed Resume, or to confirm an application. Indeed for Chrome also allows Indeed to learn about what types of jobs and Indeed product features are of interest to you, so that we can provide you with improved Job Listing searches, Job Listing recommendations and product features. – When You Apply to Jobs on Some Third-Party Websites When you apply for a job on certain third-party Websites, Indeed may also receive information about the status of your job application and the decisions taken by the Employer such as whether the application reached the interview stage and whether a job offer was accepted or rejected. This information helps Indeed further understand the effectiveness of our Sites and its features. Indeed’s use of this information is detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy. – Indeed IQ Indeed provides a programmatic campaign optimizer tool which helps Employers manage, track and optimize the performance of their advertising across a multitude of job advertising sites and platforms in real-time (“Indeed IQ”). When you click on a Job Listing powered by Indeed IQ, and when you start and complete a job application generated by Indeed IQ on an Employer’s website or a website operated by an Employer’s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information collected includes, for example, information about your device, Job Listings viewed/clicked, job applications started and completed, referring URLs and dates and times of site visits. </paragraph>

				<paragraph category="10.3;10.3">A second ground relied upon by Indeed for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Indeed or an Employer. Examples of such legitimate interests will include where Indeed sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention, or where we share your Personal Data with Indeed affiliates as detailed in section 4.14 below.

Where Indeed requires your consent, we seek it at the time of provision, and the processing will only be performed where consent is secured. For example, your consent will be sought in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message such as a Job Alert with Indeed (detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy). You can withdraw your consent, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy where applicable, or by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email). </paragraph>
