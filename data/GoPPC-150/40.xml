			Introduction

		<paragraph category="19;19">We offer a wide range of services that focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling, financing, and home improvement.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">We know that everyone’s home journey is different, and that deciding on the right place to call home is an intimate, personal experience.  Along with a wealth of information about homes, neighborhoods, market conditions, local real estate professionals, and financing options, we also use the information you give us to provide our services and help you find your next home.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="11,1.2;11,1.2">We carefully evaluate how we use data to make sure that we’re using your information to provide value for you.  On this page, we aim to explain everything you need to know about your privacy at Zillow.   If you have any questions that we haven’t answered here, you can always contact us at privacy@zillow.com.</paragraph>

			Information collected by Zillow
			</title>
		<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">When you use our services, we collect a variety of information from and about you and your devices.  Some of this information identifies you directly (like an email address) while some of it is associated with you through your account, profile, or device (like the homes you choose to save or your location data).</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">The kind of data we collect about you depends on how you use Zillow.  If you only use our services to browse for homes, we’ll have less information about you than if we help you sell your home, get a mortgage, sign your lease, or if you use any of our other transaction services.  Even if you don’t have an account with us, we may still collect some data about you, like your email address and phone number if you choose to contact a real estate agent through our platform, or your IP address and other device information when you browse our sites or use our apps.</paragraph>

			Information you give us or create using our services
			</title>
		<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">When you use our services, we often ask you for information about yourself.  This usually includes basic things like your name, email address, and phone number.  If you use our transaction services, we might ask you for more sensitive data like your income, housing history, and credit score.  If you contribute information, such as agent reviews, we’ll store that as well.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">You may also provide information about other people through our services. For example, if you share a home listing with someone, we will collect that person’s email address as part of your account information.</paragraph>

				Zillow Offers
				</title>
			<paragraph category="8,9.1,11;8,9.1,11">Zillow Offers extends cash offers on residential real estate in select U.S. cities.  If you ask for an offer on your home, we will ask you for information about you and your home. This includes contact information (such as an email address or phone number), identifying information about you, and details about your home.  We may also take some photos of your home so we know what types of repairs may be necessary.  If we agree to buy your home, we’ll need to collect more information from you that is typical of any real estate transaction, including financial information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2,9.3,11;8,9.2,9.3,11">We collect similar contact and transaction-related information from you if you are interested in purchasing a Zillow-owned home.  If you choose to tour a Zillow-owned home, we collect information to verify your identity.  Zillow may collect information about you from third parties if needed to verify your identity.</paragraph>

			<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">When you use Zillow’s home search brands (including Zillow, Trulia, HotPads, StreetEasy, NakedApartments, and OutEast) to find a home to buy or rent, we give you lots of tools to find your next home.  If you tell us what you’re looking for, such as the type of home or number of bedrooms, we save that information so that we can tailor your search results to what you’re looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="11;11">We also help you connect with local real estate agents, homebuilders, property managers, mortgage loan officers, and other real estate professionals.  If you choose to contact one of these pros through our platform, we ask for your name, email address, and phone number so that we can reach you and connect you with the right person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="4.3;4.3">You can also claim your home on Zillow and edit home facts such as the square footage, number of bathrooms, and most recent renovation year.  We link the information you provide to your account.</paragraph>

				Rental Tools
				</title>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">You can use Zillow to apply for rental housing, sign your lease, and even pay your rent.  When you choose to use these features, we collect information from you to process your transaction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">During the rental application process, we collect your information like your email address and phone number, employment history, rental history, income, and credit score.  You can use our tools to pull your credit report and criminal background check to include in your application, but Zillow doesn’t store your Social Security number and we don’t collect or see the credit or background check reports. We partner with Experian and Checkr to generate those reports and make them available only to you and the landlords you choose to send them to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">When you pay your rent through Zillow, we collect your transaction information, but we don’t store your payment account details.  Instead, we use trusted partners to collect and store that data.  If you use your bank account to pay your rent, our service provider Plaid collects personal and financial information from your bank or other financial institution. By using Zillow to make your rent payments, you are granting Zillow and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. Your information will be transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with the Plaid Privacy Policy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">If you sign your lease documents through Zillow, we will collect and store your contact information, signature, and any other information contained in the lease documents, which can vary by state and city.</paragraph>
