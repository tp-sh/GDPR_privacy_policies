		<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (which we’ll refer to as “Privacy Statement”) to explain how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with us and our offerings, services and experiences. This Privacy Statement is global in nature, meaning that it is applicable to all websites and offerings in the Intuit group companies , and it describes our privacy practices when we process: </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">a) Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “Tax Preparation Information”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services; </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="11;11">b) Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of the Intuit platform, which is collectively, all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) by Intuit Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries other than Tax Preparation Information (the “Intuit Platform”); and/or </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="11;11">c) Personal information as necessary to manage, run and improve our business. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="1.2,17;1.2,17">Intuit Inc. determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information (“Information Controller”). Intuit Inc. may share your personal data with other Intuit group companies to process as joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data, please contact us in the section “How to Contact Us” below. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="2.2;2.2">This Privacy Statement does not apply where Intuit processes personal information as a service provider on behalf of a customer or entity who acts as the Information Controller, for example, the customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant Information Controller and our agreements with such business or entity will govern our processing of personal information. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="1.2;1.2">In certain circumstances, there may be more than one Information Controller processing your information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as an Information Controller. In these situations, we act as an independent Information Controller over our processing activities – meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other Information Controller. The other Information Controller may have their own obligations under applicable information privacy law, and you may need to speak with the other Information Controller directly for questions on how they process your personal information. </paragraph>

If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization. </paragraph>
			<paragraph category="6;6">Your use of the Intuit Platform as p art of an organization’s account may be subject to the organization’s policies, which may be different from this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services. </paragraph>
