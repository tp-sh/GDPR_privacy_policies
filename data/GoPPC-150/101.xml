			<paragraph category="8,9.1,11,17.2;8,9.1,11,17.2">Certain WebMD users located in the United States may be eligible to participate in WebMD Lab Testing, a service powered by PWNHealth, which enables you to place a secure online order for certain lab tests. Once you’ve ordered your test, you’ll visit a designated testing center where an experienced lab technician will collect your samples. WebMD has selected PWNHealth to provide care coordination (including independent physician review of test orders) and other administrative services (including processing credit card payments for the lab test orders). Ordering a lab test with WebMD Lab Testing requires you to register with WebMD. WebMD will share the personal information you use to register with WebMD with PWNHealth for purposes of processing and administering your lab test order. You will be able to access your lab test orders and results from PWNHealth through your WebMD account but WebMD will never receive your lab test results or your payment information. Only PWNHealth will have access to this information. PWNHealth may disclose to WebMD certain personal information in the aggregate which does not identify you. PWNHealth will use your personal information and other information it collects about you in providing the WebMD Lab Testing services in accordance with its privacy policy available here and terms of use available here. When you interact with WebMD Lab Testing you may interact with certain website pages that are hosted by WebMD or by PWNHealth. This Privacy Policy describes what information WebMD collects about you when you use WebMD’s Services and how that information is used, disclosed, and maintained by WebMD. PWNHealth’s privacy policy and terms of use will appear on any website page that is hosted by PWNHealth. For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy only applies to the WebMD Site pages hosted by WebMD. WebMD and PWNHealth will use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about your usage of WebMD Lab Testing, including which lab tests you have viewed and to statistically analyze trends and other user behavior on the WebMD Lab Testing pages.

If you would like to stop this tailored advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that window. Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements through the Services. Please note that your choice to stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or mobile device too. By clicking the + symbol next to the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements. The WebMD Sites do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals. This opt-out mechanism is available in the flagship WebMD App for iOS and Android, as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD Allergy).</paragraph>
