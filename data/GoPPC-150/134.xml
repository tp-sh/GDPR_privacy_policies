It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. SaveFrom uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website's visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. </paragraph>
