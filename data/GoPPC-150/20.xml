		<paragraph category="1;1">Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone — from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises — to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (“GPL”). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works. </paragraph>

		<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,9.1,9.2,9.3;8,9.1,9.2,9.3">We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect. </paragraph>

			<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples: </paragraph>
			<segment>
				<title category="8;8,9.1" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Basic account information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.1,11;8,9.1,11">We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name — and that’s it. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to create a WordPress.com account. </paragraph>

				<title category="8;8,9.1" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Public profile information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include. </paragraph>
			</segment>
			<segment>
				<title category="8;8,9.1" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Payment and contact information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">If you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us — a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a custom domain , some Longreads swag — or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made. If you use our Ecommerce Services (including Store on WordPress.com, WooCommerce Shipping &amp; Tax , and WooCommerce Payments), you’ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information. If you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like WordAds , you’ll provide some additional information — for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you. </paragraph>

				<title category="19;8,9.1" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="b">Business Profile:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile. For example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us. If you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service’s features. </paragraph>

				<paragraph category="8,9.1,1.2;8,9.1,1.2">Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly. <item>Communications with us (hi there!): You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</item> </paragraph>

			<segment>
				<title category="8;8,9.2" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Log information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com. </paragraph>

				<title category="8;8,9.2" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Usage information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). Our WooCommerce Usage Tracker also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our Admin Bar and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention. </paragraph>

				<title category="8;8,9.2" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Location information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions. </paragraph>
			</segment>
			<segment>
				<title category="16,8;16,8,9.2" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Stored information:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website. </paragraph>

				<title category="19;8,9.2" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Interactions with other users’ sites:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.2,11;8,9.2,11">We collect some information about your interactions with other users’ sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you. As another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile. </paragraph>

				<title category="19;8,9.2.1" depth="4" font-size="1.0" font-weight="1.75" tagname="strong">Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9.2.1,11;8,9.2.1,11">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Automattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.

			<paragraph category="8,9.3;8,9.3">We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature , we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service. As another example, if you use WooCommerce Payments, we’ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number. The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available. </paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9.3;8,9.3">Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services. </paragraph>
