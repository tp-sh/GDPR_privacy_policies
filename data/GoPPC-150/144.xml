		<paragraph category="10.1,10.2,10.3,10.5,10.6;10.1,10.2,10.3,10.5,10.6">Data Protection law says that we are allowed to use personal information only if we have a proper reason to do so. This includes sharing it outside Lloyds Banking Group. The law says we must have one or more of these reasons:
		<item>To fulfil a contract we have with you, or</item>
		<item>When it is our legal duty, or</item>
		<item>When it is in our legitimate interest, or</item>
		<item>When you consent to it, or</item>
		<item>When it is in the public interest.</item></paragraph>
		<paragraph category="10.3;10.3">When we have a business or commercial reason of our own to use your information, this is called a ‘legitimate interest’. We will tell you what that is, if we are going to rely on it as the reason for using your data. Even then, it must not unfairly go against your interests.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="10.2,10.5;10.2,10.5">The law and other regulations treat some types of sensitive personal information as special. This information is called ‘special categories of personal data’. We will not collect or use these types of data without your consent unless the law allows us to do so. If we do, it will only be when it is necessary:
		<item>For reasons of substantial public interest, or</item>
		<item>To establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</item></paragraph>

The groups are all listed here so that you can see what we may know about you, even if we simply get it from seeing which shops you buy things in. We don’t use all this data in the same way. Some of it is useful for marketing, or for providing services to you. But some of it is private and sensitive and we treat it that way.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,11;8,11">The law and other regulations treat some types of personal information as special. We will only collect and use these if the law allows us to do so:</paragraph>
