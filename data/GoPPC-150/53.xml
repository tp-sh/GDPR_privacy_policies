		<paragraph category="">Okta is the controller of your Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise stated.  Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that we process Personal Data in the role of a processor (or a comparable role such as “service provider” in certain jurisdictions) on behalf of our customers, including where we offer to our customers various cloud products and services, through which our customers (and/or their affiliates) connect their own websites and applications to our hosted platform, sell or offer their own products and services, send electronic communications to other individuals, or otherwise collect, use, share or process Personal Data via our cloud products and services. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="">Each of our customers, not Okta, controls whether they provide you with a subscription to the Okta identity cloud service, and if they provide you with a subscription, they control what information about you that they submit to our service. This content may include contact information (such as your first and last name, email address, and phone number), professional information (such as the department you work for at your place of employment), or other types of information a customer chooses to submit. Use of this content by Okta is governed by agreements between Okta and the Customer. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="">For detailed privacy information applicable to situations where an Okta customer (and/or a customer affiliate) who uses Okta’s cloud products and services is the controller, please reach out to the respective customer directly. We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Policy. If not stated otherwise either in this Privacy Policy or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data in the role of a processor or service provider on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates), who is the responsible controller of the applicable Personal Data. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="">If your Personal Data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of an Okta customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly. Because we may only access a customer’s data upon instruction from that customer, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Okta customer who submitted your Personal Data to us. We will refer your request to that customer and support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe. </paragraph>
		<paragraph category="">Additional information regarding Okta’s data protection obligations to our customers are set forth in our subscription agreement form and related documents, including our Trust &amp; Compliance Documentation, all of which are available online at https://www.okta.com/agreements . </paragraph>

				<paragraph category="8,9,11;8,9,11">Like most websites, applications, and software across the Internet, Okta collects certain Personal Data. This type of data collection allows us to better understand how individuals use our websites, products and services and how they perform. For example, we may collect metadata about you, including technical data about your performance or use of our website, products and services. We may also collect device data about you to help us determine that users from one type of device use our websites, products and services in different ways than users of a different type of device, which in turn allows us to improve our websites, products and services, such as through optimizing the screen size of Okta mobile applications, or making sure our customers’ users have a more efficient user experience. </paragraph>
				<paragraph category="8,9;8,9">One common technology we use to collect metadata that may be considered Personal Data is our use of cookies. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your web browser and that help us recognize your browser or device as a unique visitor in different ways based on the type of cookie. The three main types of cookies are: </paragraph>

				<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">We use functional cookies to help enhance our websites’ performance, for market research, or other analytics or advertising that is not tied to a specific individual. For example, we may use Google analytics to help us track how many individuals visited our website. We may also utilize HTML5 local storage cookies for the reasons described in this section.

				<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">We use targeting and advertising cookies to help us understand our marketing efforts and to reach potential customers across the web. For example, we contract with third-party advertising networks that may track your activity over time and across different channels, including our websites, email activity, and other websites and applications that display advertisements. They may use this tracking information to understand and predict your interests, to display an advertisement for Okta on another website, or email you with a marketing communication for an Okta product. </paragraph>

				<paragraph category="4,8,9.2,11;4,8,9.2,11">A second common technology we use to collect metadata that may be considered Personal Data is beacon technology. We use beacons in our websites and in email communications to you. Beacons provide us with information about your activity and help us to improve our business operations and strategy, such as by understanding our email communications’ functionality and improving our websites and content. For example, if you click on a marketing email we send to you about a new product or service, the beacon will provide signals to us that you and your organization may be interested in learning more.
