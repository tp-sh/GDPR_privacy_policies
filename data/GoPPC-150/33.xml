Accordingly, we are happy to offer transparency and access controls to help users take advantage of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:</paragraph>
		<item>Right of access - the right to be informed of, and request access to, the personal data we process about you;</item>
		<item>Right to rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;</item>
		<item>Right to erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;</item>
		<item>Right to restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;</item>
		<item>Right to object -</item>
		<item>the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;</item>
		<item>the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;</item>
		<item>Right to data portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party's service; and</item>

		<item>Notification Settings (accessed via your account page) - allows you to choose which marketing communications you receive from Spotify. You may toggle these settings to opt in or out of receiving different types of email and push notifications. Please note that email marketing messages from Spotify include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself (e.g. an unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you). Clicking on the link in an email will opt you out of further messages of that category (e.g. Artist Updates). You can use the Notification Settings page to exercise choices about all categories of email and push marketing communication.</item>

A key source of information is the Data Rights and Privacy Settings article which includes answers to "frequently asked questions" about personal data processing in the Spotify Service.</item>
