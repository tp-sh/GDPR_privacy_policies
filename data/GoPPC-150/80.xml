		<paragraph category="11;11">Live2Coursera enables instructors to record, share, and upload lectures, including those recorded using Third Party Offerings, to Coursera for their students to view on the students’ mobile devices or computers. In addition to the activities outlined elsewhere in our Privacy Notice, Live2Coursera users are directed to review the following:</paragraph>
		<item>Coursera will collect the audio and video content instructors choose to upload through Third Party Offerings, as well as the instructor’s name, email address, and thumbnail image. Instructors may also provide us with the contact information of their students to allow Coursera to share the link to that content with those students. Instructors should ensure that the proper consents and permissions are obtained from these students before sharing their contact information. Please note that the audio and video content instructors provide to Coursera may include the voices of students participating in the live lecture, and that we may make all such content publicly available to all users of our platform.</item>
		<item>Coursera will use your information to provide and operate our Live2Coursera services and will make certain information available to other Live2Coursera participants: For example, we will allow students to view the content uploaded by their instructors and will allow instructors to know which students have viewed their lectures. </item>
		<item>Coursera may also share certain information about your use of Live2Coursera Services back with any associated Third Party Offering. Please note that when you interact with any Third Party Offering, such Third Party Offering may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. We have no control over, do not review, and are not responsible for a Third Party Offering's privacy practices. We recommend that you review any and all Third Party Offering’s privacy notice for more information. </item>
