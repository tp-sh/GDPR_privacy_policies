				What information do we collect when you use the NHS website?

			<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">When you use the NHS website, we use various technologies to collect information automatically – such as your IP address. This is commonplace across all internet services to enable the investigation of issues such as service availability and the identification of malicious use. This information is then kept in our internet access logs.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">We also collect some personal information directly – for example, when you actively submit details like your postcode to find nearby services.</paragraph>

In some cases, tracking is used to show user progress through a tool. This information will not be shared with third parties. All our tools store the number of times a user has visited the tool. Some tools also store information about how far you got through a tool, so you do not have to restart the tool if you use it again.</paragraph>

				Syndication
				</title>
			<paragraph category="11;11">We offer a free syndication service that enables partner organisations to pull content from the NHS website via an application programming interface (API) and display it on their website, app or service.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="10.1,11;10.1,11">In line with the syndication standard licence agreement, we require personal information of those using this service for contractual purposes. We use the data to inform subscribers of changes to functionality, structure or features within the syndicated content, or if there is a breach of the agreement. We also use subscriber's personal data to feed into internal reports, which identify active callers of the API alongside their usage.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="4.9;4.9">While an active subscriber is receiving syndicated content we will continue to store their personal data. A partner can remove their own account without admin assistance via the API developer portal. Once an account has been closed by either the user or an admin, we will no longer store their data.</paragraph>

While we do not capture any specific information about you as part of this service, the searches, including postcode and other personal information, are saved in our logs and analytics tools. Ideally we would only use part postcodes but this renders the searches ineffectual in rural areas.</paragraph>

				Profile Information Management System (PIMS)

		<paragraph category="8,9.1,11;8,9.1,11">If you are a PIMS profile editor, we collect personal data from you on registration. The personal data that we collect includes your name, email address, organisation name and job title. We use your personal data to provide the PIMS service and to communicate with you by email for PIMS service related purposes. Occasionally we may contact you for research purposes with the objective of improving the PIMS service or the service information that we provide on the NHS website.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="10.5;10.5">PIMS enables you to add staff information on to your service profile(s). Before doing so, you need to ensure that you acquire and record their consent unless the information is already in the public domain (for example, published on your corporate website or included in a professional body medical register).</paragraph>

		<paragraph category="11;11">We may use social media management tools (such as Hootsuite) to help deliver elements of our service to you. Any personally identifiable data processed using these tools is supplied by the platforms we use, in accordance with their terms and conditions.</paragraph>

		<paragraph category="17;17">For example, if you interact with us in a way that raises serious concerns about your mental health, we may share your personal details with local NHS services to ensure that you are offered appropriate support.</paragraph>
		<paragraph category="16;16">You should be aware that social networks may control some of the data associated with interactions between you (the user) and us (the NHS website) on their platforms. For example, we will be able to delete our own records of a private message conversation if you request us to do so, but social networks may store a copy of this conversation that we are unable to access.</paragraph>

					Understanding how social networks use your data
