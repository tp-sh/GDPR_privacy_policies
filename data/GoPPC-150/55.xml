However, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data. </paragraph>

			2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data
			</title>
		<paragraph category="10;10">We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</paragraph>

				3.1. Basic Account Data
				</title>
			<paragraph category="8,9.1;8,9.1">Telegram is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="6,8,9.1,17;6,8,9.1,17">To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like. </paragraph>
			<paragraph category="19;8,9">We do not require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).</paragraph>

				3.2. Your E-mail Address
				</title>
			<paragraph category="6,8,9.1;6,8,9.1">When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.</paragraph>

					3.3.1. Cloud Chats
					</title>
				<paragraph category="11,16;11,16">Telegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.</paragraph>
		</segment>
			<segment>
				<title tagname="h5" depth="1" font-size="1.6" font-weight="1.75" category="19;8,9">
					3.3.2. Secret Chats
					</title>
				<paragraph category="4,16;4,16">Secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.</paragraph>
		</segment>
			<segment>
				<title tagname="h5" depth="1" font-size="1.6" font-weight="1.75" category="19;8,9">
					3.3.3. Media in Secret Chats
					</title>
				<paragraph category="16.3;16.3">When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.</paragraph>
		</segment>
			<segment>
				<title tagname="h5" depth="1" font-size="1.6" font-weight="1.75" category="19;8,9">
					3.3.4. Public Chats
					</title>
				<paragraph category="8,9;8,9">In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above). Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.</paragraph>

				3.4. Phone Number and Contacts
				</title>
			<paragraph category="4.1;4.1">Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="11,16;11,16">We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="19;8,9">Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram. </paragraph>
			<paragraph category="4.9;4.9">You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Data Settings.</paragraph>

				3.5. Location Data
				</title>
			<paragraph category="8,9;8,9">If you share a location in a chat, this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9;8,9">If you share your Live Location in any chat or turn on ’Make Myself Visible’ in People Nearby, Telegram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it, even when the app is closed – for as long as you keep these optional features activated.</paragraph>

				4.1. Storing Data
				</title>
			<paragraph category="12,16;12,16">If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands. These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space. However, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram. As such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers. All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.</paragraph>

			<paragraph category="12,16;12,16">Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient. Before this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient. While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information. In this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.</paragraph>

To do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently. A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).

			<paragraph category="8,9;8,9">Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots. Bots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.

				</title>
			<paragraph category="8,9;8,9">You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:</paragraph>
			<item>By sending messages to a bot.</item>
			<item>By using an inline bot.</item>
			<item>By participating in a group with a bot.</item>

				6.3. What Data Bots Receive
				</title>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).</paragraph>
			<paragraph category="8,9.2;8,9.2">Bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.</paragraph>
			<item>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.</item>
			<item>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads). </item>
			<item>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.</item>
			<item>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g. @gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.</item>
			<item>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access. If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.</item>

				10.2. Messages
				</title>
			<item>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.</item>
			<item>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending. Otherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history. This means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.</item>
			<item>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides. There is no time limit. Any party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.</item>
			<item>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants. Note that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.</item>

				10.3. Self-Destructing Messages
				</title>
			<paragraph category="4.4;4.4">Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct. As soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.). Media with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews. The timer is triggered when they are viewed.</paragraph>
