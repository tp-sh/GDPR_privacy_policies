Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world.  ","[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

 advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest
 you. A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more
 attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts). We offer a number of data segments, both
 proprietary and from our data partners , to our Customers so that they
 may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and
 advertisements. Taboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what
 we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your
 racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning
 your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or
 biometric data). In connection with our Services, our Customers may use these standard health-related segments about
 non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over
 the counter medications. In addition, Taboola offers our Customers standard
 political-related segments that may indicate general political sentiment,
 interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation. ","[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

 advertisements to you. 5.2.4 Where Taboola Collects Your Personal Information We automatically collect User Information when Users interact with our Services that
 appear on our Customers’ websites and digital properties. Like most other web-based
 services, we collect this User Information through cookies and other technologies. We
 may also obtain Information about you from our data partners. Taboola collects Information either directly from you during your use of our Sites and
 Services or from third parties that independently collect this Information from you, and
 we may combine the Information that we collect from these various sources. For more
 information about these collection methods, please see Sections 2.1 and 3.1 above. 5.2.5 How Taboola Shares Your Personal Information Taboola may disclose or make available your pseudonymous Personal Information to our
 trusted partners. In most cases when we do so, we have contractually restricted their
 uses of this data for only Taboola’s business purposes. Under the CCPA, such disclosures
 of Personal Information to service providers are not deemed to be a “sale” and thus are
 not prohibited after you exercise your right to cease or restrict disclosures or sales
 of your Personal Information to third parties. In any instances where we have not
 entered into a service provider relationship with such third parties, we will stop
 sharing your Personal Information when you instruct us not to “sell” your Personal
 Information. ","5. Regional Privacy Rights5.2 Notice to Individuals in the

 collecting and using the Personal Data described above (also referred to in this Section
 5.3 as “Thailand Data”) will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific
 context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only (i) where we have your
 consent to do so, (ii) where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you,
 or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your
 data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also
 have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the
 Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a
 contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether
 the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
 consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate
 interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time

Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.

You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile. The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public. If you like, Retweet, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Periscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions. So are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay. Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public. For example, other people may tag you in a photo  (if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and we’ll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).
Similarly, we may collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party). Relevant legitimate interests include a) to market to you or make you offers that we believe will interest you; b) to analyse and understand how our services are used and so to improve them; c) for fraud prevention or prevention of other criminal acts; or d) to keep our systems secure.
